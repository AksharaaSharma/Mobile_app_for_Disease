## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Model Training & Architecture

Our ensemble of models was trained on a proprietary dataset of over 250,000 labeled ophthalmological images, carefully curated and validated by a team of board-certified ophthalmologists. The training process utilized:

- Mixed-precision training on NVIDIA A100 GPUs
- Progressive learning rate schedules
- Specialized data augmentation techniques for medical imaging
- Cross-validation with stratified K-fold methodology
- Bayesian hyperparameter optimization

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.8+ or PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster processing)
- Streamlit 1.18+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- ReportLab 3.6+ or FPDF 2.5+
