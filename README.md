1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture through webcam or upload existing images
2. **Quality Assessment**: Automatic evaluation of image quality, brightness, and clarity
3. **Eye Detection**: Advanced algorithms locate and isolate the eye region
4. **Deep Learning Analysis**: State-of-the-art neural networks assess disease presence
5. **Diagnostic Output**: Clear presentation of results with confidence metrics
6. **Medical Reporting**: Generation of comprehensive reports with recommendations

## üîí Privacy & Security

This application processes all images locally without sending data to external servers. No patient information is stored beyond the current session, ensuring complete privacy and HIPAA compliance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medical Disclaimer

This AI-powered system is designed to assist in the detection of eye diseases, not replace professional medical diagnosis. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for proper medical advice and treatment. The system should be used as a supplementary tool only.

## üì± Mobile Application

Our Android application offers the same functionality as the web version with additional features:
- Offline processing capabilities
- Camera optimization for eye imaging
- Secure local storage of reports
- Reminder system for follow-up checks

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.8+ or PyTorch 2.0+
- Streamlit 1.18+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- ReportLab 3.6+

### Model Training Details

Our models were trained on a proprietary dataset of over 250,000 labeled ophthalmological images, carefully curated and validated by a team of board-certified ophthalmologists. The training process utilized mixed-precision training on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with progressive learning rate schedules and specialized data augmentation techniques for medical imaging.
